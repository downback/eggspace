            Intervening Spheres is a series of exhibitions in a chain-like cycle with the goal of connecting 
            early-career artists and recent art school graduates from within Switzerland and abroad.
            Each exhibition features two artists, and each artist will appear in two shows. In their first exhibition, 
            they will react to the work of a previous artist. In the second, they will show different or altered work that will be reacted to by the following artist.
