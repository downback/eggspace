                Egg presents <span class="italic">Night-blooming</span>, featuring work from ZHdK alumna Jana Kohler and Prague-based artist 
                Richard Janecek examining fallacies in the realms of love and technology. Kohler, in collaboration 
                with Rémy Sax, performs a variation of the country song, <span class="italic">Never Promised You a Rose Garden</span>, to 
                investigate tropes and illusions of romance. Janecek’s video work also follows the theme of 
                misconceptions with a fictionalized narrative created in collaboration with a writing AI on the 
                conspiracy theories surrounding the 5G network.

            Jana Kohler (*1998, St. Gallen, CH) completed her Fine Arts studies at ZHdK in 2021 and has since been working 
            as an artist and bookseller. Using the medium of video, she explores characters that wander through dream worlds 
            and constantly reinvent themselves. The works relate to cinéma through their visual appearance and attempt to find 
            a new language for the familiar and break up genres. Selfbuilt sets and amateur actors are always involved in the 
            productions. She is also part of the band "Bingo Hall River Boys" and works as a DJ.<br><br>
            Richard Janeček (*1990) is a Czech intermedia artist who graduated from the Studio of Photography and New Media at FAMU 
            in Prague. He is focused on the image found in the late period of the photographic method moving smoothly into the field of 
            virtual culture.<br><br>
            Gregor Vogel is a Zürich artist who recently escaped to New Zealand.
