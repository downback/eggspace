                <span class="italic">A Phantasmagorical Bloom</span> blends fantasy and shades of reality with a tinge of the uncanny, inviting us to enter 
                the half-life between waking and sleeping. Estonian-born artist Hanna Samoson exhibits her video 2222, which 
                follows her trek across the surreal and glacial landscapes of the islands of Estonia in winter. As she is accompanied 
                by a demon-faced companion, the landscape becomes populated with strange, arcane happenings. ZHdK alumna Jana 
                Kohler shows a selection of clips from her oeuvre which reveal the central themes in her creative universe. 
                The exploration of femininity recurs, always through the highly aesthetic lens of fiction.

            Peilian Li is a Swiss-Chinese visual artist, performer and writer. Her works forgo ordinary logic in favor of 
            an onirical elation of ideas that often touch the identity issues of being an Asian immigrant in the Western world. 
            She graduated with a Master in visual arts at ECAL / Ecole Cantonale d’Art de Lausanne in 2022 and she currently lives 
            and works in Lausanne, Switzerland.<br><br>
            César Axel (*1992) is a Mexican visual and multimedia artist living and working in Lausanne. His work is informed 
            by fields diverse as art theory, philosophy, political economy, and technology studies, allowing for a radical expansion of 
            the core concerns of art’s social scope, or, the role it can play in the transformation of our political environment, 
            our effects, as well as technologically-mediated subjectivities. César Axel has participated in exhibitions in Switzerland, 
            USA, Mexico, Bucharest and China.
