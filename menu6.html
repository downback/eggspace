                In the final exhibition of Egg’s Intervening Spheres, <span class="italic">A Haven for Phantoms</span>, the last artist of the 
                cycle joins with the first to present two stories of cybernetic entities created by human idiosyncrasies 
                and failures. ECAL’s Peilian Li exhibits work that references wordplay created by Chinese censorship. 
                An homage to the alpaca, which in Mandarin is a near homonym for “fuck you mother,” is a playful query 
                into the efficacy of suppression, when now even the emoji of an alpaca carries double meaning. Interacting 
                with her golems more directly, Estonian artist Hanna Samoson shares a digital book she created which documents 
                an attempt to purchase a computer to better create 3D models, relying on those same 3D models to help her raise the money. 
                Alive but nonliving, they challenge her competence and are expressed as antagonists within the story.

            Peilian Li is a Swiss-Chinese visual artist, performer and writer. Her works forgo ordinary logic in favor of 
            an onirical elation of ideas that often touch the identity issues of being an Asian immigrant in the Western world. 
            She graduated with a Master in visual arts at ECAL / Ecole Cantonale d’Art de Lausanne in 2022 and she currently 
            lives and works in Lausanne, Switzerland.<br><br>
            Hanna Samoson (1987) explores the boundaries of art and tries to perceive the unknown. Being in constant motion as an intuitive 
            creator, her work is characterized by quick and spontaneous decisions. She studied photography at the Estonian Academy of Arts 
            and graduated from the FAMU Academy of Performing Arts in Prague this year. In the autumn of 2020 she walked the future route 
            of Rail Baltic from Ikla to Tallinn as an endurance art performance.
